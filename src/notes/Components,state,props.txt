--LIFECYCLE
    1. Life Cycle Methods -- Used in Class
    example in AboutUs.js
    3 Major Lifecycle Methods
        -- ComponentDidMount() --> called when component is created
        -- ComponentDidUpdate() --> called when anything is updated in component
        -- ComponentDidUnmount() --> Called when component is dead
        Constructor --> called before component is created
        Also have constructor; must call super() in first line

    2. Life Cyscle Hooks -- Used in Function
        We can use methods in function, so for that hooks are used.
        There is only one type of hook --> useEffect() 
        example in Mobile.js
        import {useEffect,  --> Hook
        useState}  --> To use state
        from 'react'

--STATE
    like a varialble 
    example in AboutUs.js

--PROPS
properties added to component, it is used between 2 components, from parent component 2 child component
Example in App.js and AboutUS.js
In App.js  <AboutUs Website="www.react.js"/> 
In AboutUs.js
    --This is using prop in class with 'this' keyword
 console.warn(this.props.Website)
    
    -- This is using prop in function 
        0. In App.js --> <ContactUs Adress={adress}/>
        1. import React,{useEffect,useState} from 'react'
        2. need to give props argument in function -->function ContactUs (props){ 
        3. props.Adress
     useEffect(()=>{
        console.warn("check props from hook adress:",props.Adress)
    })
